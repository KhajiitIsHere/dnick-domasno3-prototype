            <h3>Kickflip</h3>
            <p>
                A kickflip is a common skateboard trick that pops the skater up into the air, using their feet to flip
                the board a full rotationâ€”360 degrees. With a kickflip, the board spins mid-air toward the skater. This
                skateboarding trick is performed on flat ground as well as on obstacles, like over steps or off-ramps

            <h3>Ollie</h3>
            <p>
                The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the
                rider's hands. It is the combination of stomping, also known as popping, the tail of the skateboard off
                the ground to get the board mostly vertical, jumping, and sliding the front foot forward to level out
                the
                skateboard at the peak of the jump.
                The ollie is a fundamental skill in skateboarding. Ollies are necessary to leap onto, over, or off of
                obstacles. As most flip tricks depend on it, the ollie is often the first skill to be learned by a new
                skateboarder and typically takes considerable practice to learn.

            <h3>Manual</h3>
            <p>
                A manual is a freestyle skateboarding trick where the skateboarder shifts their weight to the back or
                front of the board in order to lift the front or back wheels into the air without the tail or nose of
                the board touching the ground. Think of a manual as the skateboarding version of popping a wheelie on a
                bicycle. Lifting the front wheels into the air is a standard manual, while lifting the back wheels into
                the air is called a nose manual.

            <h3>Tic-tacs</h3>
            <p>
                There are two ways of gaining speed on a skateboard. You either push off on the ground or do tic-tacs.

                Tic-tacs are a series of consecutive heelside-to-toeside kickturns that, when chained together, will
                help you pick up speed.

                Unlike pushing off, when performing a tic-tac, your feet are always on the board.

                You may also use tic-tacs to change direction while gaining speed.
